## **Notes**

HTML Page Essential
- Head:
    - `<title>`: Name of the page that will be displayed in the browser tab
    - `<script>`: Internal JavaScript that powers the front-end logic of the web page
    - `<style>`: Internal CSS that allows you to customise the look and feel of certain elements or the whole page
    - `<link>`: Allows you to link with external CSS and JavaScript code
    - `<meta>`: Extra information about the page, such as which character set to use (charset)
- Note:
    - `<meta>` is commonly used for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and ensuring that the web page is responsive and compatible on different devices and screen sizes
    - External CSS and JS are always preferred over Internal JS, to ensure that your code is well maintained and organised

Basic Tags
- Heading:              `<h1></h1>, <h2></h2> ... <h6></h6>`
- Paragraph:            `<p></p>`
- Link:                 `<a href="https://www.google.co.nz">Google</a>`
- Image:                `<img src="source_URL" alt="Text when image cannot be loaded">`
- Line break:           `<br> or <br/>`
- Style application:    `<div>`

Table and List
```html
<!-- Table example -->
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>ID</th>
        <th>First name</th>
        <th>Last name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <th>Leone1</th>
        <th>Meyer</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <th>Dewitt</th>
        <th>Vega</th>
    </tr>
</table>

<!-- List example -->

<!-- U for Unordered list (bullet points) -->
<ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

<!-- O for Ordered 1, 2, 3, ... -->
<ol>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
    <li>Kiwifruit</li>
</ol>
```

Form
```html
<form action="">
    <label for="username">Username</label><br />
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" /><br />
    
    <label for="password">Password</label><br />
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" /><br />

    <button type="submit">Log in</button>
</form>
```

- The "Submit" type buttom will tell the form-handler to trigger an action once activated by the user
- The "Password" type will render any character typed by the user with ***, thus obscuring whatever was written
- There are many other types we can use for our form, such as email, checkbox, range, etc.

CSS
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which allows you to add style to most HTML elements in the body
    - Select by element: Changes the theme of all the tags with the same tag name
    - Select by ID: Changes the style for one specific element (uses #idName)
    - Select by Class: Most commonly used and very flexible (uses .classname)
- The best way to write CSS is to either use the Browser Developer Tool (F12), or to try your idea on CodePen

Bootstrap
- Bootstrap is a frontend template that allows you to create professional looking websites effectively
- There is a great amount of support from the community, namely on Stack Overflow
- It makes minimal changes to an existing page by adding Popper.js, which is Bootstrap's CSS and JS
- Every CSS styles uses class selectors to change the style on a web page

```html
<h3>This is my awesome title!</h1>
```
What does it look like in a rendered page?
> This renders the text as a level 3 heading. 

**4.**  How to add a comment to a HTML page?
> You enclose your comments as follows: `<!-- This is a comment -->`. These are ignored by HTML when rendered in a browser

**5.**  Name 3 commonly used CSS selectors.
> The 3 commonly used selectors are element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.

**6.**  WhatÊ¼s the difference between padding and margin in CSS?
> Padding is the amount of space between the element's border and the element's content, whereas margin is the amount of space around the element's border.

**7.**  What units can you use when defining a padding? (Name at least 2.)
